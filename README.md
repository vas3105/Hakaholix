## 1. The Problem

Traditional travel platforms are generic and time-consuming. Users are forced to manually research dozens of sites to build an itinerary that *truly* matches their unique interests, budget, and desired "vibe."

## 2. Our Solution

Odyssey is an AI-powered travel assistant that does the work for you.

Through a natural, conversational interface (including voice), our AI understands the user's *true* intent. It then generates a unique, end-to-end travel plan.

Our system is designed to go beyond the standard tourist spots to provide a hyper-personalized itinerary, ensuring a one-of-a-kind trip, every time.


## 3. Current Status

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is in the very early stages of development for a 36-hour hackathon.
